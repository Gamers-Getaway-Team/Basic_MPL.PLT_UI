Thank you for using our basic UI

in order to use this program, you will need to have python installed and set up a virtual environment.

you can download python from python.org

the following is how you should set up the virtual environment. THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE AFTER INSTALLING PYTHON


for windows:

open a command line in the folder with the graphing.py file

enter the following: py -m venv nameofenvironment

enter the following: nameofenvironment\scripts\activate.bat

the env name should now be before the prompt. This means you are now in the named venv you created.

enter the following; pip install -r requirements.txt

you will need to be in the venv you created before you run 'py graphing.py'. It is recommended that you set up a batch file to automate this.
